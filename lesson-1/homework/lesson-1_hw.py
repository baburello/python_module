#Task 1 Given a side of square. Find its perimeter and area.
a = 10 #square side
p = 4 * a #Perimeter
s = a * a # Square
print(p)
print(s)

#Task 2 Given diameter of circle. Find its length.
d = 10 #diameter of a circle
l = 2 * 3.14 # l = P * d
print(l)

#Task 3 Given two numbers a and b. Find their mean.
a = 3
b = 4
m = (a + b)/2
print(m)

#Task 4 Given two numbers a and b. Find their sum, product and square of each number.
a = 5
b = 6

sum = a + b
product = a * b
a_square = a ** 2
b_square = b ** 2

print(sum)
print(product)
print(a_square)
print(b_square)
